        <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>½ head of garlic, individual cloves peeled and minced</li>
        <li>2 - 3 pounds of baby back ribs, cut cross-wise into 2” to 3” pieces and separated (or an equal amount of pork belly or shoulder, cut into large pieces)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 tomato, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>2 - 3 tablespoons fish sauce (preferably Viet Huong brand)</li>
        <li>1 packet of sinigang/tamarind mix (sinigang sa sampalok; such as Mama Sita's brand)</li>
        <li>1 piece of daikon radish, peeled and cut into thick slices (or two pieces of taro, skinned and cubed)</li>
        <li>12 - 15 pieces of okra</li>
        <li>12 string beans, cut in 2-inch lengths</li>
        <li>1 bunch (about 12 ounces) water spinach (kangkong), thick, tough ends cut off, stalks and leaves cut into long 6” lengths*</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps in Making Sinigang</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add some oil to a large pot—enough to cover the bottom with a thin slick—and heat it over medium. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until it’s beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for about a minute.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat to high and add the ribs to the pot, seasoning them with a pinch of salt and a bit of pepper. Brown the meat, turning it, until it is golden on most sides. (The timing will depend on how crowded the pot is.)</li>
        <li>Add the tomato to the pot, give it a stir or two, then add enough water to the pot so that there’s about 1 inch of liquid above the top of the meat.</li>
        <li>Bring the liquid to boil, then turn the heat to medium-low. Stir in one or two tablespoons of fish sauce (depending on how salty your brand is), then stir in the packet of sinigang mix.</li>
        <li>Partially cover the pot and simmer everything until the meat is fork tender, about 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the daikon (or taro) and simmer it for 8 (or 10) minutes. Add the okra and the string beans and simmer them for another 8 minutes. Add the water spinach to the pot, give everything a stir, then turn off the heat and cover the pot so that the water spinach cooks gently in the remaining heat until the thickest parts of the stems are tender enough to eat.</li>
        <li>Serve the sinigang hot, with rice. (Joe likes to mix the rice into the soup.)</li>
    </ol>
